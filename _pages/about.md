Hello, my name is Liao Nan. I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a master's degree. My supervisor is [Dr. Nawaz](https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/6392-muhammad-nawaz). Since graduation, I have been a geography teacher in the High School Affiliated to Shenzhen University of Technology, but I have never stopped my scientific research and exploration. My research interest is in resilient cities and quantitative analysis related to human geography.
